# Climate Models
A web application to visually and informatively display Earth’s regional environmental data such as chlorophyll concentration, bathymetry, net productivity(net intake of carbon dioxide mainly by flora), average land and sea temperature and so on.  This project was employed as a project in participation for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019.

The interactive globe---made using Javascript---was a path sourced from a file on the NASA World Wind website. Think of the digital globe as a canvas. Homogenous to a canvas, multiple layers of “paint” could be coated upon the globe.   

  

This allowed us to visually map the data from NASA Earth Observations, or NEO, onto the globe itself---like a canvas. NEO is the data library for satellite imageries collected from most, if not all, of NASA’s constellation of Earth Observing System satellites. Over 50 different global datasets are represented with daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots, and images are available in a variety of formats including JPEG and PNG; the dataset ranges from active fires to vegetation index around the globe. NEO’s prominent Web Mapping Service (WMS) gives users the ability to access its maps content via standardized programming interfaces. In layman's term, we were able to source the climate map models then project it onto my digital globe.
The climate models of the Earth that we added were nitrogen dioxide concentration, average land and sea temperature, ultraviolet index, bathymetry, active fires, chlorophyll concentration, and net primary productivity. The above datasets are regional and were a snapshot of certain timespan; for example, the average land and sea temperature visualize the respective regional temperatures across the globe for the past 1 month.  

  

The web-app allows users to gain insight from interacting with the global climate models. Chlorophyll concentration gives us an understanding of the phytoplankton population around the coastal areas; a visual representation of nitrogen dioxide concentration distinguishes densely populated regions or of high ozone collection. The awareness in regards to global disasters like the severity of the active fires that have been occurring globally can too be raised by the “Active Fires” visualization data. To take it a step further, users can overlay two or more climate layers simultaneously. Case in point, by overlaying average sea temperature and chlorophyll concentration in conjunction, we can interpret a correlation between them. As would be depicted, higher chlorophyll concentration correlates to lower regional sea temperature---phytoplankton tend to be more plentiful in regions with lower sea temperature; because cold waters tend to consist of more nutrients than warm waters. In fact, I now know the exact location of the Mariana Trench along the Philippine Sea, by projecting the global bathymetry data.
